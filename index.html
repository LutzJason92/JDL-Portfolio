                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> Maker of things, thinker of thoughts. A proud Denver resident originally born in Germany, I was a military brat who was taken across the country with my family before spreading my wings in Chicago at 17 years old. After living here for 7 years and pursuing many passions, I decided to embark on another journey by enrolling in a University of Denver Coding Bootcamp.

                <p>Though I now make digital assets, I spent years making large pieces of material, into several smaller pieces of material. Sometimes it turns out pretty cool, but its always a mess.</p>
